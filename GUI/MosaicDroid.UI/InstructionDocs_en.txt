=== 🤖 Pixel-Wall-E Language Guide 🤖 ===

 🎨 ENTRY MODE 🎨 :
 - You may type your program directly into the left-hand editor, or click Load to open a “.pw” file.
 - Click Save to export the current editor contents to a “.pw” file.

🔱 BUTTONS 🔱:
 - Size [n] + Resize [n]: sets the canvas to a n×n pixels.
 - Run: if the code is correct it will paint your drawing on the canvas.
 - Load / Save: loads from or saves to a “.pw” script file.

COMMANDS (each must end with a newline):
  • Spawn(int x, int y)
      Initializes Wall-E’s starting coordinates.  
      If they are outside of the canvas bounds, returns a runtime error
      Must be the first (and only) Spawn in one program.

  • Color("Name") or Color("#RRGGBB")
      Changes the brush color from all the WPF-known colors. Please refer to this link to find the complete list

      Note that “White” acts as an eraser and “Transparent” paint nothing.  

  • Size(int k)
      Change brush thickness. If k is even, the next lower odd number is used.  

  • DrawLine(dx, dy, distance)
      From the current pixel, draws a straight line `distance` pixels in direction  (`dx`,`dy`), where each of dx,dy ∈ {–1,0,1} and distance > 0.  

  • DrawCircle(dx, dy, radius) 
      From the current pixel, moves `radius` in (dx,dy) then draws the circumference only.  

  • DrawRectangle(dx, dy, dist, width, height) 
      From the current position, moves to the center of a `width`×`height` rectangle and draws its border.  

  • Fill() 
      Flood-fill the contiguous region under the current pixel with the current brush color.  
        
  • Move(int x,int y)
      Moves Pixel Wall-e to the position (x,y) only if its inside te canvas bounds, if not reports a runtime error

VARIABLES & EXPRESSIONS (must have a jumpline follow it):
  • Assignment:
      `myVar <- Expression`  
  • Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`  
  • Boolean: comparisons `==,>,<,>=,<=`, `&&`, `||`  

🎵 BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS 🎵:
  • GetActualX() / GetActualY()
      Returns Wall-E’s current X or Y.  
  • GetCanvasSize()  
      Returns the current canvas size n.  
  • GetColorCount(color, x1, y1, x2, y2)  
      Counts pixels of `color` in the rectangle between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  
  • IsBrushColor(color)
      returns 1 if the current brush matches `color`, else 0.  
  • IsBrushSize(size)
      Returns 1 if the current brush thickness == `size`, else 0.  
  • IsCanvasColor(color, vertical, horizontal)
      Returns 1 if the pixel at (X + horizontal, Y +vertical from the current position equals `color`, else 0.  

CONDITIONAL JUMPS & LABELS:
  • Labels: 
      `myLabel` on its own line marks a jump‐target.  
  • GoTo [myLabel] (condition)
      If `condition` is true, resume execution at `myLabel`.
